# Legal Stuff

This document contains all of the legal nonsense I was forced to write. I tried to keep it minimal, as the service is incredibly simple and the majority of a typical TOS / Privacy Policy simply isn't applicable.

### In short:

This is a free service I operate as a hobby. It may be unreliable at times. If I have to block you from using the bot, I will.

The bot reads your messages in order to function. I take privacy very seriously. Your messages will not be stored, shared or sold.

### Data Collection

In order for the bot to function, it reads message content to look for Rickroll links. Message content is discarded after processing. Links that are flagged as Rickrolls are stored in the bot's database.

### Contact

If you have any concerns about user privacy, including requests for data deletion or to opt out of message content processing, you can email me at `funpolice@nwunder.com` or reach out to `nwunder` on Discord.
